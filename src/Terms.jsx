            Reports may contain information from the auto auction database if
            the vehicle has ever been sold via auction. This includes photos and
            details that the public has access to on the auto auction website
            when the vehicle was available for sale. We also offer this
            information in Vin Check Central Auto Auction Records Reports. Vin
            Check Central Vehicle Inspection Reports are made up of data from
            our representatives that perform the vehicle inspections

        <div className="dt">
          <p style={{ fontSize: "15px" }}>
            1. Not Experts, No Authentication. Vin Check Central affiliates who
            perform vehicle inspections are not experts in any field. They do
            not have or apply special or specific skills, knowledge, or
            expertise to provide vehicle inspections. Reports reflect layperson
            inspections and opinions, arrived at during the time of a personal
            examination that will not include a test drive of any kind. Vin
            Check Central is not liable for any damages resulting from the use
            of, or non-use of, this information. Should you rely on any Vin
            Check Central inspection, you do so at your own risk
            <br />
            2. No Guarantee. Information contained in our reports is not
            guaranteed. It may not be accurate, timely, or complete.
            Additionally, as it is atypical for us to take possession of
            vehicles, we cannot guarantee that substitutions or changes will not
            be made after our inspection is completed. We offer no guarantee
            regarding the condition of any vehicle
            <br />
            3. Authorized Communications. Inspectors may not be communicated
            with directly. Additionally, only an individual who places an order
            may contact us regarding said order
            <br />
            4. Scope of Order. We are not required to divulge any information or
            facts not within the express scope of an order that are not
            contained in our expressly described services
            <br />
            5. Order Fulfillment Policy. Our goal is to provide you with your
            report no later than four business days following your order
            placement. Due to unforeseeable volume and other factors, we do not
            guarantee this timeline, it is simply a goal
            <br />
            6. Cancellation Policy. We will not issue refunds for orders
            canceled after an inspector begins implementing an order. If an
            order is canceled prior to an inspector starting to implement the
            order, we will refund 50% of the order price. We define implementing
            the order as the inspector having made an appointment with the
            owner/seller of the vehicle or having arrived at the property where
            the owner/seller has the vehicle located
            <br />
            7. Title to Goods or Property. We do not verify, warranty, or
            guarantee that the person we conduct our inspection with actually
            owns the vehicle
            <br />
            8. Use of subcontractors. We reserve the right to subcontract our
            Services as we see fit
            <br />
            9. Maximum Inspection Time. At most our inspector will spend 15
            minutes examining the vehicle for which you have ordered an
            inspection. The exception to this is any approved custom order that
            necessitates more time for examination
            <br />
            10. No Shows. You will be charged the full fee of the inspection if
            our inspector connects with the owner and sets a time to perform the
            inspection. The charge will still be applied even if the seller
            fails to appear at the site of the inspection at the appointed time
            and we do
            <br />
            11. Entry Upon Private Property. Should we find it necessary to
            enter private property to complete your order, it will be your
            responsibility to secure any required consent and provide us with
            confirmation of that consent. We will not be held responsible for
            expenses or losses of any sort that we may incur when gaining entry
            to private property to complete your order
            <br />
            12. No Offer. We provide our Services in the United States only. We
